PROTOTYPE GOALS:
Background music terrible to improved mechanic demo
-COMPLETE: Grab any coin in Prototype.java to trigger the change in background music. 
 We will be inserting different versions of the same song at the time of triggering in the alpha.

Background changing mechanic demo
-COMPLETE. Grab any coin in Prototype.java to trigger this event.

Demo of the hookshot mechanic (hookshot to platform)
-COMPLETE: Use Left-Right keys to Move, Up key to Jump, 
 and LeftButton-MouseClick on any platform in Prototype.java to Tween to that location.

EXTRA:
NotesCollection.java is a prototype of another possible level design, 
where collection of the notes generates a song gradually, 
then plays all collected notes at the end of the level.
